**Day 1**
<br>
Talked to Aaron about the game and he sent me some designs of what he wanted. He wanted a retro style game. 

**Day 2**
<br>
Started on the game. Made a simple map and added the player to the game, started leanring how to add player health.
If the player falls off the map he dies.

**Day 3**
<br>
Added an enemy for the first level and fleshed out the level with more platforms for the player to run around
<br>
Made the enemy fire arrows at the player. These arrows are shot towards the players position in the game
<br>
Added a sword swipe feature.
<br>
Added ReadMe

**Day 4**
<br>
Made the player be able to kill the enemy in level 1. I've also changed the sword swipe so that the player drops a nuke
instead
<br>
Added infinty jump, game is too hard to play with single jump or double jump

<br>
Had meeting with Aaron and talked about the changes I've made. Aaron was okay with the changes I made.

<br>
Still no progress made

**Day 8**
<br>
Made level 2 decided to make it a vertical level to make it more challenging for the player.
<br>
Add two enemies to the level making it even harder to do this level

**Day 9**
<br>
Made level 3 this is a straight forward level but I added 2 enemies and a Dog that follows you on the map.

**Day 10**
<br>
Aaron wanted to know how the game was going. He played through the levels and found them enjoyable. He said that the
player should not be able to kill the dog on level 3. He also sent me sprites for the bosses to add to the game.

**Day 11**
<br>
Made the changes Aaron could me to made. I used the **1** unity asset pack that we allowed tomuse for the dog following 
the player on the map for level 3.
<br>
Made updates to the README


**Day 12**
<br>
Created all the boss levels with Aaron. He wants all the levels to be the same but he wants each boss to be different
in the levels. 
<br>
Created all the boss levels today. Each boss is diffrent to the last boss

**Day 13**
<br>
Syncing the levels together

<br>
Added pause menu to game
<br>
Fixed the homescreen

**Day 15**
<br>
Showed Aaron the full game and he said "I am impressed with the game. I enjoyed seeing it progress at a steady pace. Anytime Sammar asked for clarity on some
feature I was happy to oblige, as it was usually an improvement on my original design."

**Day 16**
<br>
Preparing the game for test cases.

## TEST CASES
1.	All the controls should be responsive, if the player hits the jump button the character jumps.
2.	The player should always start on the far-left side of the screen.
3.	The player should be bound inside the frame of each screen they are on, only able to exit to a new screen when they reach the far-right wall or if they die by falling through a pitfall.
4.	The levels should end after the player has defeated that levels boss. They should not be able to continue as usual until the boss is defeated.
5.	When the player beats the boss, they should be able to use the upgrades they just unlocked (as mentioned in the gameplay section) in the next level.
6.	 When the player gets hit four times, they lose all their health. The game should restart from the start of whatever level they are on.
7.	If the player dies three times, they lose all their lives, this means the game is over and they should get a game over screen.
8.	If the player is hit by an enemy the player character should jump back, and have a period of invulnerability of about two seconds afterwards i.e. Not able to be hit repeatability.
9.	If the player falls through any of the pitfalls in the levels, they should die instantly regardless of how much health they have left.
10.	Once the player reaches the end point of a level, they should be moved onto the start of the next level.
